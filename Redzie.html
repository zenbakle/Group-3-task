Experience so far at Code Plateau
Code Plateau has been an interesting, confusing and challenging. After the interview it felt like the program would not begin and I began to think that it was just another scam. Just when I was at the verge of giving up the orientation date was set. The orientation was quite impactful and also an eye opener to the challenges we have and also the mission and vision of Code Plateau. It was interesting and also a thing a joy for Plateau State to tap into the world's fastest growing industry.
The first week was more of exposing us into the world of computer technology and to be honest it was a very interesting because it gave me a good understandidng of what a computer sysytem is all about and what it can do. The second week (hmmmmmmm.......) more challenging than the first week, found myself getting lost, then got back on track through the early or if I should use the word preliminary stage of programming because we have not even started the coding yet.
In general, I for one feel that it is an interesting experience to actually know what really happens in the background of of the Graphic Interface we use everyday.
