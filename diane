Hi I'm Diane I am very inquisitive and adventurous person and a kind of person that loves a challenge and love meeting them head on till I came across code Plateau and this time, I have met a worthy match. Before Code Plateau, I had no background on anything tech related and hated anything related to computer reasons being that I little understanding of computer or tech but till now code plateau has been very enlightening, educating and challenging. The instructors( most of them) has been really nice, friendly and pretty understanding considering that it is not that easy to teach adults. Thus far they have made a seemily difficult and usually daunting topic very comprehensible and fun. Code Plateau has also given me an oopurtunity to network and meet amazing people who i wouldn't have had the oppurtunity to meet otherwise Well thus far code plateau has been awesome, informative, challenging and really fun I can't help but look forward to more of code Plateau
