I came into nhub a week after the programme had started because i wasnt aware the programme had started. Very unsure as to wether or not i would catch up, i looked around and everybody seemed so confident and knew what they were doing. THis made me all the more intimidated but thank heavens i met an old school mate in the university whom encouraged and assured me i would catch up and as God would have it, we were matched into the same group for the first class assignment and i am confident i will do as good as anybody can.
The entire program has been interesting and the instructors have been nice and approachable and the opportunity to meet new people has made it all the more interesting.
